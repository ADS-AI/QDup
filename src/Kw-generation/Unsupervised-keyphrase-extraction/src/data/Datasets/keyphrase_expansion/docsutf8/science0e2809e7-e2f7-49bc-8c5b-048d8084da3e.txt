0:01- [Voiceover] To help us understand
0:02how cell to cell communication works,
0:05I want you to think back to your
0:07good old elementary school days.
0:09In particular, I want you to think about the things
0:11you'd have to do in order to secretly
0:13talk to your friends during class.
0:16Here you are sitting in your classroom
0:18and you desperately want to tell your friend here something
0:21so you write a little note and you pass it to them.
0:24>From your hand directly to their hand.
0:27They see the note but no one else sees it,
0:29it's just for them.
0:31But let's say you want to tell your friend
0:33across the room something.
0:35I don't know about you but when I was in elementary school
0:38I used to write notes on pieces of paper,
0:41fold it up into a paper airplane,
0:43and I had pretty good aim back then
0:44so I'd throw my paper airplane over to my friend
0:47across some distance
0:49and they'd get my message.
0:50And again, they'd be the only one who got the message,
0:53no one else got my little paper airplane message.
0:57If I wanted to tell a few friends something,
0:59I might call a little huddle and actually say a few things
1:03just to this group of friends here.
1:05My voice would cross this small distance between us.
1:10Now, let's kick things up a notch.
1:12I was, kind of, a rebel in elementary school
1:14and sometimes I'd go to the secretary's desk
1:17and take over the intercom
1:18to say funny things to my friends,
1:20maybe to tell them to meet me at the flagpole
1:23or on the playground at recess or something.
1:26This intercom message that I'd send out,
1:28that would go to everyone,
1:29it would be broadcasted to the whole school.
1:32Those who wanted to come meet me would do that
1:35and those who wouldn't, wouldn't.
1:37We can think of cells as little people
1:39that do really similar things
1:42because you might not always think about it
1:44but it's really, really important
1:45that cells are able to talk to each other.
1:48Evolutionarily, cells being able
1:50to communicate with each other
1:51are a major reason why we're as complex as we are,
1:54as human beings.
1:57I'll give you examples of when cells
1:58might talk to each other as we go along here.
2:02How do cells pass notes to each?
2:04How do they directly communicate with each other?
2:07One way is by, actual, direct contact.
2:11Cells have lots of protein
2:12stuck into their plasma membranes here
2:14that serve a lot of functions.
2:17The most important one is for communication.
2:20Let's look at a macrophage here,
2:21this is a type of white blood cell
2:23that's a part of your immune system.
2:25When these macrophages see a foreign invader,
2:28maybe a little bacteria or a virus,
2:31they can ingest it.
2:32They can ingest it then they break it down
2:35and then they display a little piece of it
2:37which is now called an antigen,
2:39on their surface.
2:41They show it off on their surface with one of these
2:43cell surface proteins here.
2:46This one in particular is called an MHC II protein.
2:51Now, this little antigen here has become
2:53the note that they want to pass on,
2:55this antigen is the message.
2:57Another white blood cell,
2:58maybe a helper T cell might come along
3:01and then grab hold of this antigen here
3:03with one of its cell membrane proteins,
3:06in this case a T cell receptor.
3:09Just by doing this, the macrophage here managed
3:12to pass a message onto the helper T cell here.
3:15Now, based on which antigen this is,
3:18the T cell can decide whether to start
3:20a full-blown immune response.
3:23Maybe it'll go off and ring more alarm bells
3:25by activating other antibody cells which are called B cells
3:29or not, maybe they'll just do nothing.
3:30It just depends on what type of note this is.
3:34When cells directly touch to communicate,
3:38sort of, unsurprisingly this is called
3:40direct cell-cell communication or just direct binding.
3:45Now, what about our other methods of communication?
3:49Cells can also communicate over short distances.
3:52This is our paper airplane here.
3:54For example, let's look at two neurons.
3:57They're in close approximation
3:59but one end of a neuron
4:01doesn't quite touch the start of the next neuron here,
4:04there's a little gap there called the synaptic cleft.
4:08What neurons do is they release
4:09little signals called neurotransmitters
4:12to communicate with each other.
4:14Neurotransmitters get released from the end of this neuron
4:18and they'll diffuse across this little distance here
4:20until they bind onto one of the dendrites
4:23of this next neuron.
4:25That effectively passes the message on
4:27from this neuron to this next neuron.
4:30The paper airplane is thrown from here
4:33to here.
4:34This is called neural communication.
4:37Over here, just like calling a huddle,
4:40one cell can talk to a small group of cells locally as well.
4:45For example, just underneath our skin,
4:47let's say the skin inside our nose,
4:49we have these immune cells called mast cells.
4:53They're really important in mediating allergic reactions,
4:56that's why I purposely picked the nose here.
4:59Let's say you're allergic to certain pollens
5:02and one day in the spring you find yourself
5:04walking through the park.
5:06Inevitably, you'd breathe in some pollen
5:09and then the pollen would go on to attach
5:11to these antibodies stuck to our mast cells.
5:15What happens as a response to this is that
5:17the mast cells release little chemical signals
5:19called histamine.
5:21Histamine acts as our short-range message.
5:24It travels around to cells in the area
5:26then let them know that an allergen has been found
5:29and lets them know to start preparing
5:31for an allergic reaction to take place.
5:34This type of communication is called paracrine signaling,
5:37paracrine, meaning nearby.
5:40Finally, the intercom take over.
5:42How do our cells talk to huge groups of cells at once?
5:47They do that by endocrine signaling.
5:50For example, cells in our Pituitary gland in our brain
5:53make a lot of the important hormones in our bodies.
5:57Let's say that they're making Growth hormone, GH,
6:00to send around to all the cells in the body.
6:02Sending his hormone is their form of communication here.
6:06They'll create the Growth hormone
6:08inside their cell bodies
6:11and they'll release them into the bloodstream.
6:14Now, our Growth hormone can travel through the bloodstream
6:16and get to, literally, any place in the body.
6:20Every cell of your body has the opportunity
6:22to get this Growth hormone message.
6:25It doesn't mean that every cell
6:26will, necessarily, respond to the message.
6:29Some cells just don't have the right proteins
6:31to bind certain hormones,
6:32but either way, you can see that this is a
6:34long distance form of communication.
