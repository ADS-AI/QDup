anomalous dimension matrices for twist-2 operators
anomalous dimension matrix
anomalous dimensions obtained from universal anomalous dimensions γuni(j) by shifting its arguments by an integer number
Calculations in the maximally extended N=4 SYM, where the coupling constant is not renormalized
Evolution equations for quasi-partonic operators
evolution equations for the matrix elements of quasi-partonic operators in the multicolor limit Nc→∞
fixed by the superconformal invariance 
high symmetry may significantly simplify the structure of these equations
investigate the BFKL and DGLAP equations in the case of supersymmetric theories
