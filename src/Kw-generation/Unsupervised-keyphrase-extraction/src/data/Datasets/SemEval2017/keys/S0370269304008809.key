approximately locate
a single missed level
correlations in a sequence
detecting one missing level
detecting the location of, say, one missing level on an otherwise complete sequence
error correcting codes can be constructed
information theory concepts
locate in the last case a single missed level
missed level can be obviously detected as a hole in the spectrum
no correlations and therefore no redundancy are present
picket fence
Poissonian sequence
sequence of equally spaced levels
study of spectral fluctuations
two-dimensional chaotic systems
Weyl's law describing the average spectral density
