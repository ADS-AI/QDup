carbon nanotubes
“carpet” growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) from catalyst particles embedded in a substrate
“catalytic gas flow CVD”
chemical vapor deposition
CNTs
CVD
CVD techniques
does not use pre-formed catalyst particles
fluidized bed
HiPco (high-pressure CO) process
metal catalyst particles
MWNTs
observed in arc discharge fullerene reactors
polymers
produced through a variety of synthesis techniques
SWNTs
synthesized in the liquid phase
the fullerene production method of laser ablation
the most effective, cheap, and scalable CVD techniques
the reaction of a gaseous carbon compound as feedstock
the reaction of a gaseous carbon feedstock to form the nanotubes on catalyst particles
this technique
