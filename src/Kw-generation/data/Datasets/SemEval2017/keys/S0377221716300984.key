a direct cooperation protocol
agent-based system
agents
approach
Capacitated Vehicle Routing benchmarks
deal with a variety of different problem domains
each agent is implementing a different metaheuristic/local search combination
embodies a set of well known metaheuristics with different configurations
framework
Good patterns
