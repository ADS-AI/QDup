3-branes with negative tension
axial symmetry in the two-dimensional internal space,
construct the most general solutions
de Sitter or anti-de Sitter symmetry
interpretation of 3-branes with negative tension
non-singular away from a conical defect
non-singular solutions with a four-dimensional Poincaré
prove the uniqueness
