0:00- [Instructor] Suppose I drop two identical balls
0:02from the same height.
0:03One I just let go of it, so it just falls straight down.
0:07Another one, let's say I have a slide
0:10and I make it slide down, it rolls down.
0:13The question you want to try and answer
0:14is in which of the two cases
0:16gravity does more work.
0:20Okay?
0:21So let's see, how to we answer this question?
0:24First we need to know how to calculate work.
0:26We know work done equals force acting on a body
0:30multiplied by the displacement of that body, right?
0:34So let's try and figure out the work
0:35done in both these cases.
0:37Now which is the force that's acting on them?
0:40Since we're introducing gravity,
0:41that's the force we should talk about,
0:43and the gravitational force on both of them
0:45must be the same because they are identical balls,
0:47they have the same mass,
0:48and you might know that gravitational force is mg,
0:51so that part must be the same.
0:53Now let's look at the displacement part.
0:56In the first case, the ball falls straight down.
0:59So the displacement is just the height of the ball,
1:04and so in the first case, the work done becomes
1:07mg times h.
1:09But what about the second case?
1:11Now in the second case,
1:13the displacement is from here to here
1:16which is more than the height of the ball, right?
1:19This length, as you can see,
1:21is larger than this length, larger than the height.
1:24And so if we call this as, let's say s,
1:27we might say in this case the work done
1:29will be mg into this displacement,
1:32and therefore we might conclude that
1:35more work is done by gravity in this case, right?
1:39Well, an important thing to see over here
1:41is that the force and the displacement
1:44in this case are not in the same direction.
1:47You see, they're in a different direction.
1:50And whenever we say we are calculating work
1:52as force into displacement,
1:54that displacement has to be calculated
1:57in the direction of the force.
2:01And so I guess the goal of the video
2:02is to try and figure out
2:04whenever the force and displacement
2:06are not in the same direction,
2:07how do we calculate work done?
2:09What is the meaning of this statement?
2:13So let's look at these two cases
2:15in a little bit more detail, okay.
2:17So in the first case, the force of gravity is down
2:19and the object just falls down.
2:22No surprise.
2:23In the second case, gravity's down,
2:26but the ball is falling down at an angle.
2:29It's sliding down at an angle.
2:31So again, not surprising, but what does it mean?
2:34This means gravity can make things accelerate
2:37in other directions as well,
2:40not just down, but in other directions as well, right?
2:44But there's a difference between these two.
2:48In which case do you think the ball accelerates
2:50more quickly?
2:52Well, I'm pretty sure you'll agree it's in the first case.
2:54In the first case the ball would accelerate
2:55very quickly compared to the second one.
2:57Here, let me show you this.
2:59So if I drop the ball,
3:01see how quickly it just fell down.
3:03In the second case, I'll make it slide,
3:06and now notice it's a little slower than before.
3:09Again, to see it clearly,
3:11let's do a comparison side by side in slow motion,
3:14and you can see immediately the ball here
3:17accelerates down, but over here notice
3:19it's so much slower.
3:22So the ball accelerates much slower here
3:24compared to this.
3:25So what can we conclude from this?
3:28Because the acceleration is slower,
3:30we could say the effect of gravity felt by this ball
3:34must be less, right,
3:35because it's feeling less force
3:37and therefore smaller acceleration.
3:40So we can conclude that gravity has an effect
3:43in this direction, but that effect is smaller
3:46compared to the previous one, right?
3:49So at an angle, the effect of gravity reduces.
3:53So we can say less effect along this angle.
3:57Okay, in a third case what we'll do is
4:00we'll try to make that object slide horizontally
4:05due to gravity.
4:06What'll happen?
4:07Well, gravity's acting down,
4:09and we're trying to make this object
4:11go forward, let's say.
4:13Do you think this is going to happen?
4:15I'm pretty sure you'll agree nothing's going to happen
4:17in this case, right?
4:18This object is not going to move at all.
4:22Again, I can just show you that.
4:24I'll just keep an object, this time it's horizontal.
4:27Here the ball is moving because my hand is shaking,
4:29but I'm pretty sure you'll agree
4:30that the ball is just going to be at rest
4:32if this was perfectly leveled, right?
4:35So in this case, gravity cannot affect
4:38the motion at all.
4:40So we can say that gravity
4:42has no effect in the horizontal direction.
4:45Does that make sense?
4:46Because it's not able to accelerate this ball.
4:52So in this case we can say gravity has zero effect.
4:55Now before we put all of this together
4:57and try to make sense of this,
4:58let me tell you that this is not just for gravity.
5:00This can be seen in any force.
5:03To give you an example, let's say you take a mop
5:05and you push it forward,
5:06and you'll expect the mop to accelerate forward
5:09and speed up in the forward direction.
5:10No surprise, right?
5:12But take that mop and now push it at an angle,
5:16and again, that force can accelerate it,
5:20meaning even though this force is acting at an angle,
5:22it has an effect in this direction
5:26just like what we saw over here.
5:28So this force also has effects in other direction,
5:31but again, you might agree that over here
5:33the effect is a little smaller,
5:35because now the mop will not accelerate
5:37as much as it accelerated in this case, right?
5:39So the effect has reduced,
5:41and eventually, if you push the mop straight down,
5:45now you'll see it has absolutely no effect
5:47in the horizontal direction.
5:49So this force has zero effect in this direction.
5:53So if you put it all together,
5:54what do we understand?
5:55First of all we see that forces can have
5:57effects in other directions as well.
6:00But what's important is that as the angle
6:04between the force and the motion increases,
6:06as this angle starts increasing,
6:09the effect starts reducing.
6:10You see the effect is maximum
6:13when the force and the motion are in line with each other.
6:15But as the motion starts making an angle
6:17with the force, the effect reduces.
6:19And when the angle becomes 90 degrees,
6:23as you can see, the effect becomes zero.
6:27This is the most important thing, okay?
6:29This means that forces have no effect
6:32in perpendicular direction.
6:33It has zero effects in perpendicular direction.
6:38So what can we say about the work done
6:40in this particular case?
6:43Well, let's take an example.
6:44So imagine I take a ball and I keep it on
6:46a perfectly horizontal slide,
6:48and let's think about the work done by gravity.
6:50Gravity's pulling it down.
6:52Let's say I push this ball now
6:54and make it displace horizontally.
6:57What is the work done by gravity?
6:59Can we just say it is the gravitational force
7:01multiplied by the displacement?
7:02No, because the angle between the gravity
7:07and the displacement is 90 degrees,
7:08we can now say gravity has no effect
7:10in this direction like we saw earlier.
7:13So gravity's not causing this displacement at all,
7:16and therefore we can say the work done by gravity
7:18is zero, because gravity's not the one
7:21that displaced this body.
7:22Does that make sense?
7:24In a similar manner, imagine somebody's carrying
7:27a luggage on their head,
7:29and let's say they move forward,
7:31displacing that luggage.
7:33What is the work done by their force on the luggage?
7:37Again, that's zero.
7:38Why?
7:39Because they're pushing on the luggage up,
7:43and this is perpendicular to direction of the displacement.
7:46And so we can say this force has no effect
7:48on this direction, it did not cause
7:50this displacement at all,
7:52and therefore the work done by this force
7:54on the luggage must be zero.
7:57And so, in general, if the force and displacement
7:59are perpendicular to each other,
8:01work done by that force must be zero.
8:05So now let's see how this knowledge helps us
8:07in answering our original question.
8:10So we want to calculate the work done in this case, right?
8:14Now instead of the ball falling,
8:16sliding straight down, let's assume,
8:19let's assume for a moment that the ball
8:22is going on a staircase.
8:25So let's assume that the ball is going forward,
8:27then coming down, then going forward,
8:28then coming down, and so on and so forth.
8:30Let's assume it's going that way.
8:31I know it's not really doing that,
8:32but let's calculate the work in this case first.
8:35It'll help us to figure out what happens
8:36in the work in the sliding case as well.
8:39So what is the work during this entire motion?
8:42Well again, it's going to be force times displacement.
8:45We know the force, which is mg,
8:47but what is the displacement?
8:48Should we take this entire displacement,
8:50should we add up all these displacements?
8:53No, because we know now that
8:55during the horizontal motion,
8:57gravity's not doing any work.
8:59So this displacement doesn't come into the picture.
9:01During the vertical motion gravity is doing work.
9:04Gravity is pulling and make it displace,
9:06so this matters.
9:08Again, during the horizontal motion,
9:09that displacement doesn't matter.
9:11Again, during the vertical motion, it matters.
9:14So, during the horizontal motion,
9:16since the work done is zero,
9:17we can just get rid of the displacement,
9:19that displacement doesn't come into our formula.
9:23So let's get rid of that displacement.
9:25And so the only displacement that matters to us
9:28is the one that happens in the direction
9:31of the force of gravity, right?
9:34And that's what we meant earlier.
9:37When you're calculating the work done,
9:39what matters is the displacement that happens
9:41in the direction of the force.
9:43Only that displacement should come into the picture.
9:48Okay, so what is this total displacement?
9:50Well, we just have to add all of them up.
9:53Now if we add all of them up,
9:55notice what we get.
9:57We just get the entire height
10:00of the fall from the ground,
10:02which means the displacement over here
10:05has to be h itself,
10:07and therefore the work done in this case
10:09is exactly the same as the work done in this case.
10:12So even though the ball is going down on a staircase,
10:15going forward and going down and so on,
10:18the work done by gravity must be the same.
10:22Now, of course, you might say well, okay,
10:23but that doesn't answer my question.
10:25Our original question was not on a staircase,
10:27it was going down on a slide, right?
10:29How do we answer that?
10:31Well, we'll come to that.
10:32Now instead of thinking of a big staircase,
10:35let's assume we made the step size smaller,
10:38so we had a longer staircase.
10:42Okay,
10:43now imagine again the ball goes forward
10:45and comes down and so on and so forth.
10:47What'll be the work done?
10:49Well again, we don't have to worry about
10:51the horizontal displacements
10:52because the work done by gravity would be zero.
10:55Right, in the perpendicular direction,
10:56gravity has no effect.
10:58So the only displacement that matters to us
11:00is in the vertical direction,
11:01in the direction of the force.
11:04Again, if we add up all those
11:07displacements, notice we end up with just h.
11:10So this means even if I make this staircase smaller,
11:13the work done by gravity should still be the same.
11:17So now let me make the staircase even smaller.
11:21The work done should still be the same.
11:23Let's make the staircase even smaller.
11:25The work done would still be the same.
11:27Now you can imagine if we go on making
11:30the staircase smaller and smaller and smaller
11:32and smaller, the motion of the ball
11:34would start becoming smoother and smoother,
11:36and eventually, if you imagine the staircase
11:38while it's super, super, super, super, super small,
11:41we can pretty much assume that that staircase
11:43is now like the slide.
11:45And we can now say that the work done
11:47in this slide must also be the same.
11:51So in both the cases, gravity does exactly
11:55the same work.
11:58Amazing, isn't it?
12:00Now we can extend this even further.
12:02Instead of going on a slide, let's say the ball
12:05went on some curve like this.
12:08What is the work done by gravity in this case?
12:11Again, it should be the same.
12:13Why?
12:14Because again you can think of it as
12:15going in a very tiny staircase from here to here,
12:19and when you add up all the displacements,
12:21only the vertical displacements will matter,
12:23and again, the total displacement will still be just h.
12:27So even in this complicated curvy example,
12:29work done by gravity is still the same.
12:31And so now we can extend this in general
12:33and say even if our ball is going in some
12:36crazy, weird path,
12:38then the work done by gravity will again
12:40be just the same.
12:42So it seems like the work done by gravity
12:44doesn't depend on what path it takes
12:46to go from one point to another.
12:48It only depends upon the height
12:51that it covers, right?
12:53The height is all that matters.
12:55It does not depend on the path.
12:57And this is important, because tomorrow
12:59if we have our object going in some crazy path
13:03and we are asked to calculate
13:04the work done by gravity,
13:05we don't have to worry too much about the path taken.
13:07We just say it's the force into the height
13:09that it covers from one point to another.
13:14And so what did we learn in this video?
13:17By looking at some day-to-day life examples,
13:19we saw that forces can have effects
13:21in other directions as well.
13:24But what's important is that forces
13:25have maximum effect in the line of the force,
13:29and as the angle between the motion
13:30and the force increases,
13:32its effect starts decreasing.
13:35And eventually when the angle between the force
13:37and the motion becomes 90 degrees,
13:39we see that the force has zero effect.
13:42Forces have zero effect in perpendicular direction,
13:45and because of this, if the force
13:47and the displacement are perpendicular to each other,
13:50that work done by that force should be zero
13:52because the force had no effect in that direction.
13:55And using this, we were able to figure out
13:59that when a ball falls through some height,
14:02it doesn't matter what path it takes,
14:03whether it falls straight down
14:04or it goes through a curve,
14:06the work done will be the same.
14:08It'll be the force of gravity times the height
14:10through which it fell down,
14:12and one way to argue this is
14:14instead of imaging that it fell through a curve like this,
14:17we can imagine it went through
14:19a very, very, very tiny staircase,
14:21and then when the ball goes forward,
14:24the work done would be zero
14:25so those displacements don't matter,
14:27and the only displacement that'll come
14:29into our equation is the vertical displacement,
14:32and when you add all of them up,
14:33we saw it'll just be the height.
14:36And so regardless of what path the ball takes,
14:39the work done by gravity doesn't depend on the path,
14:42it only depends upon the height
14:43through which it falls.
