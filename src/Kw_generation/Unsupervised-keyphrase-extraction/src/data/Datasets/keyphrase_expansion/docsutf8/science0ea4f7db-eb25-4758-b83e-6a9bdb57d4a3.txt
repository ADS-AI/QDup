0:02- [Voiceover] Arthritis is a term that we hear
0:04all the time, right, but to break down this word,
0:07arthritis, -itis means inflammation.
0:10Everywhere in medicine it's gonna refer
0:12to inflammation, and whatever before it
0:15is telling us where the inflammation is.
0:17In this case, arthr- is referring to joints.
0:21Now we have joints in our body that don't move,
0:24kind of like pieces of our skull that come together.
0:27Those are not meant to move,
0:29and it's just holding our head together,
0:31but the joints that we're thinking of
0:33and the joints that we're gonna talk about
0:34are the joints that do move.
0:36Your knees, your elbows, so on and so forth.
0:39In those joints, the rough structure, pattern,
0:41is always gonna have the end of one bone
0:44and then another bone with a space in between
0:48that is enclosed by a joint capsule,
0:51and it's lined with synovium, or synovial lining,
0:54which produces a fluid that we call
0:57synovial fluid to lubricate,
0:59and on the surface of these bones we have cartilage.
1:03So that's gonna be the rough structure,
1:04and I'll draw this in much better detail later.
1:06Any kind of joint inflammation qualifies as arthritis,
1:11and there's actually a lot of different kinds.
1:13So if we ask ourselves, "What is arthritis,"
1:15I wanna go through some of the big categories
1:18of things that qualify as arthritis,
1:20and the kinds of people that are likely to get each kind.
1:24But the first category is probably
1:26the most common category,
1:28and that's gonna be arthritis from overuse of the joint.
1:31This is probably what your grandma is talking about
1:33when she's saying, "My knee hurts.
1:34"I have arthritis."
1:36And the thing is, you and I will probably get this kind
1:38of arthritis too if we're lucky to live long enough.
1:42So the groups of people that are most likely
1:44to get this kind are those who are elderly,
1:46because they've lived longer
1:48and have used their joints longer,
1:50and also people who are obese and overweight,
1:53because the extra weight they're carrying
1:55just weighs down their joints.
1:57So obesity is correlated with more overuse,
2:01or osteoarthritis.
2:02Speaking of which, osteoarthritis is the poster child
2:06for overuse arthritis, osteo- meaning bone.
2:10Arthritis.
2:12I'm not gonna write this out every time,
2:14so from now on I'm probably gonna refer to it as OA.
2:18Lots and lots of people get this,
2:19usually in the weightbearing parts of their body
2:22or whatever is overused the most.
2:24For example, a typist might get this
2:26in her fingers or wrists.
2:28A dancer might get it in her knees.
2:30This is due to rubbing away of the cartilage
2:33and general wear and tear on the joint.
2:35We'll go into the specific pathophysiology later.
2:39The second big category,
2:40and it really qualifies as a big category,
2:43because it includes a lot of different diseases,
2:46this one's gonna be autoimmune.
2:48So auto- means self, and immune is referring
2:52to our immune system, which is usually
2:55the system that helps us fight off
2:57invasion from the environment.
3:00So essentially the body is attacking itself,
3:02and some of the famous diseases in this category
3:04you might have heard of.
3:05They include lupus, Crohn's disease,
3:07and they're often systemic,
3:09means they reach a lot of different parts of the body.
3:12The population, if we had to bet on
3:15the biggest population to have these diseases
3:17would be females, usually middle-aged females,
3:20but for now we're just gonna say females.
3:22Of course guys get them too,
3:24but if we're going with our odds,
3:25it's more common in female patients.
3:28So autoimmune arthritis.
3:30At the top of this list has to be rheumatoid arthritis.
3:33Rheumatoid.
3:36Aside from OA, this is the other huge category
3:39of people with arthritis.
3:41Rheumatoid arthritis.
3:45And even though it's very different from OA,
3:48they're often contrasted against each other
3:50because these are the most common kinds,
3:52so when we're diagnosing, we always wanna see
3:54if they're leaning towards OA or RA.
3:56So compared to OA, the patients on average
3:58might be younger, but of course elderly people
4:01get RA as well, but as you will see later,
4:03the symptoms look very different.
4:05There's a whole branch of medicine called rheumatology
4:08that deal with rheumatoid problems,
4:10so that kinda suggests how widespread it is.
4:13The thing is, rheumatoid arthritis has a unique thing
4:16we can isolate from testing the patients' blood.
4:18It's called rheumatoid factor.
4:20I'm gonna write RF.
4:21Rheumatoid factor is something you can test for,
4:24and it pushes you towards a diagnosis
4:25of rheumatoid arthritis.
4:27Now I'm mentioning this because the rest of the diseases
4:30that went on the list in the autoimmune section
4:32are collectively referred to as a seronegative arthritis.
4:37This is referring to the fact that in their serum,
4:40they don't have rheumatoid factor.
4:43So this whole category is there to separate
4:45rheumatoid arthritis from the other
4:47autoimmune arthritises.
4:49Arthritises, I don't know if that's a word,
4:51but that's what we're gonna call it.
4:53So seronegative is the first part of the word.
4:55The other half of the category refers to the fact
4:57that these diseases often involve the spine,
5:00not just the joints in our limbs that we think of.
5:03So spondylo- refers to the spine,
5:07so spondyloarthritis.
5:10The name here tells you a lot.
5:11It tells you that it's not gonna be RF positive,
5:14and it's gonna involve the spine.
5:16So we have ankylosing spondyloarthritis.
5:20Ankylosing means a fusion, fusing together,
5:23which is a common symptom in a lot
5:25of different types of arthritis,
5:27but here it's part of the name.
5:29Ankylosing spondyloarthritis.
5:32Such long words.
5:34Spondyloarthritis.
5:37I'll probably refer to this as AS.
5:39Everything's about acronyms in medicine.
5:41And then we have Reiter's syndrome,
5:43named after the person who found the disease,
5:47Reiter's syndrome.
5:49Then we're gonna have psoriatic arthritis,
5:52psoriatic, which is part of psoriasis,
5:55one of the autoimmune systemic diseases.
5:58But it also causes inflammation of the joints,
6:00so psoriatic arthritis is its own category.
6:03With the seronegative spondyloarthritis,
6:06one buzzword I want you to remember
6:08is called HLA-B27,
6:13I'm sorry, not seven.
6:14For those of you taking tests, this counts as a buzzword.
6:17Every time you see it, think of the seronegative
6:20spondyloarthritis diseases.
6:23This is an antigen, surface antigen on an immune cell.
6:26So all that means is if we have a white blood cell,
6:29HLA-B27 is an antigen that can attach to it,
6:32and it's something that these diseases have in common.
6:35We don't have to go too far into immunology here,
6:38but just remember, cement these four letters
6:40and two numbers into your head, HLA-B27,
6:43and think of autoimmune seronegative spondyloarthritis.
6:48All right, moving on.
6:49The next category is gonna be nice and straightforward.
6:53It's gonna be infectious.
6:54Even though usually the joints should be
6:57nice and closed off to the outside environment,
7:00sometimes an infection gets through,
7:03and this can give us arthritis,
7:04so the most dangerous kind is gonna be septic arthritis.
7:10So sepsis refers to an infection
7:12that's leaked into the blood.
7:14So septic arthritis, this person's gonna have fevers
7:17and systemic symptoms,
7:19but the original problem's gonna be
7:20able to be traced to a joint.
7:22And the people that are most likely to get this
7:24are young males.
7:27Think of college-aged kids, maybe slightly older.
7:30Some of the bacteria responsible include
7:32gonorrhea, chlamydia, which are the big ones.
7:35Also bacteria that live on the skin.
7:37So think of infection if the arthritis came on suddenly,
7:40it's pretty severe, and we're seeing systemic symptoms.
7:44Speaking of which, I wonder if Reiter's syndrome
7:46also fits in the infectious, because it's associated
7:48sometimes with certain viral infections,
7:52and it can develop as an aftermath of that infection.
7:55But I guess it belongs better up here,
7:57because it's not an active infection.
7:59But as we get to Reiter's syndrome later,
8:01we'll talk about that in more detail.
8:03So far we're talked about overuse of the joint,
8:06of things inside the body,
8:08the immune system attacking the joint,
8:10outside things attacking the joint,
8:13and the last category we're gonna have
8:14is gonna be things depositing in the joint
8:17that really don't belong there.
8:19Don't really know what to call this.
8:20Let's call it depository, if that makes sense.
8:23Depository.
8:25So there's not really anything attacking it per se,
8:28but the joint should be a clean, pure place,
8:32and particles that deposit there
8:34can cause a lot of inflammation and pain,
8:36and you probably already know where I'm going with this.
8:39It's gonna be gout and pseudogout.
8:44We think of these usually are isolated to certain joints
8:48in the body, and they almost always occur there,
8:51but of course they can occur in other places too,
8:54and it counts as arthritis because it's
8:56an inflammation of a joint,
8:57and they both come from depositing certain proteins
9:00in the joint space.
9:02So these four big categories round out
9:04the big things that we refer to as arthritis.
9:07All these diseases are so different,
9:09so the next time you hear arthritis,
9:11remember that's not the stereotypical knee pain
9:14that we're thinking of.
9:15So really pay attention to the symptoms
9:17that distinguish these different kinds
9:19of arthritis from each other.
