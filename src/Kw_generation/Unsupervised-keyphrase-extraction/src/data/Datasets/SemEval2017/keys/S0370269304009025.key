calculate the properties of nuclear matter as well as finite nuclei
changes to the quark and antiquark distributions of a bound proton
develop a reliable model of both the free proton and the binding of nucleons starting from the quark level
Dirac equation for the quark in infinite quark matter
each quark feels a scalar potential, −Vsq, and a vector potential, Vvq
effective nuclear force
illustrate the formal ideas developed here by applying them to a toy model
mean field approximation
