analysis of antiproton attenuation
antibaryons
antiproton
describe the experimental data of the HERMES Collaboration for hadron attenuation on nuclei
detail the spectra for different particle species (π±,K±,p,p̄)
determine σlead
dynamical studies
examine, if the formation times of mesons and antibaryons are about equal
fragmentation function
‘free’ fragmentation function
FSI
gluon radiation
hadron
hadron attenuation
hadron formation
improve our model to describe the primary photon–nucleon reaction below the PYTHIA threshold of W⩾4 GeV
in-medium change of the fragmentation function
interaction of the leading prehadrons during the formation time
K±
leading prehadrons
mesons
nuclei
nucleon
p
p̄
p+A reactions
particle species
photon
primary photon–nucleon reaction
produced (pre-)hadrons
RMh
surrounding medium
