back reaction of conformal quantum fields near singularity
brane
braneworld
evolution to singularity
example of such singularity
finite-time, future (sudden or Big Rip type) singularities
qualitatively similar conclusions
quantum effects
scale factor blows up
singularity
strong energy condition
sudden singularity
the universe may end up in de Sitter phase
we found another example of it
