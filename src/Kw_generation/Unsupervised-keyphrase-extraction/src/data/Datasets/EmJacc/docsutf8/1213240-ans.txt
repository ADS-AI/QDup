According to this approach first we calculate ascending cumulative frequencies less than and descending cumulative frequencies more than from the frequency distribution series Data are presented graphically to make 'Less than' or 'More than' Ogives From the intersecting point of two Ogives a perpendicular is drawn on the X axis The point where the perpendicular touches the OX axis median value is determined
