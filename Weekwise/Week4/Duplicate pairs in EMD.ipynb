There were many columns/features in the actual dataset though we have taken only two of them, 1st being the `question text` itself and second the `syllabus id` associated with it. \n","\n","3. A rough idea on how syllabus id can be useful is , creating large buckets of questions of same subjects and then we kind of reduce our search space for near duplicates.\n","\n","4. Though can't be sure if syllabus id are 100% correct or not (Human errors).\n","\n","5. The question text has been preprocessed.
